#  SQLite Distributed Simulation

This project simulates a distributed system where different types of data are stored in separate SQLite databases.  
It demonstrates **multi-threaded insertions** into multiple databases at the same time.

---

## Databases
- **users.db** → Stores user details (`id`, `name`, `email`)  
- **products.db** → Stores product details (`id`, `name`, `price`)  
- **orders.db** → Stores order details (`id`, `user_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`)
